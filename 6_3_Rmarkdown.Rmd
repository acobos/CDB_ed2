## Introduction

Accurate early anticipation of long-term irreversible brain damage during the acute phase of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains difficult. Using a combination of clinical scores together with brain injury-related biomarkers (NDKA and S100-beta), this study aimed at developing a multiparameter prognostic panel to facilitate early outcome prediction following aSAH.


## Methods

Blood samples of  `r nrow(aSAH)` were prospectively enrolled and analyzed. Bla, bla, bla...

The following figure shows the distribution of markers according to the patient's outcome.


```{r }
plot1 <- gf_jitter(ndka ~ outcome, data = aSAH, width = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) + coord_flip()
plot2 <- gf_jitter(s100b ~ outcome, data = aSAH, width = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) + coord_flip()
plot3 <- gf_jitter(wfns ~ outcome, data = aSAH, width = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) + coord_flip()

plot1 / plot2 / plot3
```

Figure \ref{fig:rocs} displays the ROC curves for all three markers.

```{r rocs, fig.align='center', fig.cap='ROC curves for all three markers' }
# ROC analysis
roc1 <- roc(outcome ~ ndka, data = aSAH)
roc2 <- roc(outcome ~ s100b, data = aSAH)
roc3 <- roc(outcome ~ wfns, data = aSAH)

# plot all three ROC curves
plot(roc1, col="blue")
plot(roc2, col="darkgreen", add = TRUE)
plot(roc3, col="red", add = TRUE)
legend("bottomright", 
       legend = c("ndka", "s100b", "wfns"), 
       col = c("blue", "darkgreen", "red"),
       lwd = 2)
```





```{r eval=FALSE}

# compute AUC's and CI's using bootstrap (normal approximation not appropriate here)

auc(roc1);  set.seed(1);  ci(roc1, method = "bootstrap") 
auc(roc2);  set.seed(1);  ci(roc2, method = "bootstrap") 
auc(roc3);  set.seed(1);  ci(roc3, method = "bootstrap") 

ci(roc1) %>% round(2) %>% stringr::str_flatten(", ")
stringr::str_flatten(round(ci(roc1),2), ", " )


# comparisons of wfns vs ndka and s100b
set.seed(1)
roc.test(roc3, roc1, method = "bootstrap")
set.seed(1)
roc.test(roc3, roc2, method = "bootstrap")

# ROC curve and optimal threshold
plot.roc(roc3, col="red", 
         print.auc=TRUE, 
         print.thres = "best")

# see optimal threshold
aSAH %>% gf_boxplot(wfns ~ outcome) %>% 
  gf_hline(yintercept = 3.5, lty=2, col = "red")
